# StudentInformationSystem

contributor: Tyler Pickard

Overview:
This project was built using Java. The goal was to create a system that could be used by admissions advisors to create student profiles, course profiles, and ultimately build out a course schedule for a selected student. Encapsulation was used in this project to protect the data about courses and students in their respective classes.  This also allowed for constructors to be used to easily create new courses and students.
